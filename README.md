# My Ruby code style

My Git repository to solve exercises on exercism.io. Here is my [profile for the Ruby track](https://exercism.io/profiles/AlexB52).

I always to try to make code easy to understand, to change or to optimise and that repository is a way to explain what I mean by that. It's a representation of my current coding style when writing Ruby and using object-oriented programming.

I'm accepting pull requests to discuss changes that would make the code better.
