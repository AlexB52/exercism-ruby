# Welcome

This is the Git repository I use to do the exercises on exercism.io.

I decided to display my ideal coding style when I write Ruby and object-oriented programming. This is a work in progress and it will never be perfect but at least I will try my best based on current knowledge and what I consider good code. Here is my [profile for the Ruby track](https://exercism.io/profiles/AlexB52) on exercism.io

I'm accepting pull requests to discuss changes that would make the code better.

Exercises:
- [x] hello-world
- [x] two-fer
- [x] matrix
- [x] connect
- [ ] book-store (in progress)
